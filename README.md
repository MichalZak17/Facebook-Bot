## Additional documentation

- If you want the program to reply only to a specific message.
```python
MessageReceived = message_object.text()

if MessageReceived == "MESSAGE":                
  self.send(Facebook.Message(text="REPLAY")), thread_id = thread_id, thread_type = thread_type)
                self.markAsDelivered(author_id, thread_id)
                self.markAsRead(thread_id)
```

- If you want the program to reply to a specific message drawn from the list, I recommend using the lower () function to reduce the possible number of messages that will be checked and to which you want to reply.

```python
import random

MessageReceived = message_object.text.lower()

List = ["MESSAGE1", "MESSAGE2"]

if MessageReceived in List:             
  `self.send(Facebook.Message(text=random.choice(List)), thread_id = thread_id, thread_type = thread_type)
    self.markAsDelivered(author_id, thread_id)
    self.markAsRead(thread_id)
```
You can make also another list with replays.

- If you want to send an emote.

```python          
self.send(Facebook.Message(text = "üëç", emoji_size = EmojiSize.LARGE), thread_id = thread_id, thread_type = thread_type)
```
